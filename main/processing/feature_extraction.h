 * ‚öì MAIN TREASURE SORTING FUNCTION - EXTRACT ADVANCED FEATURES
 * 
 * This be the heart of our treasure sorting operation! Takes clean, fused
 * sensor data and transforms it into a comprehensive set of meaningful
 * features ready for gesture recognition.
 * 
 * TREASURE TYPES EXTRACTED:
 * üîπ CURRENT VALUES: Immediate sensor readings (19 features)
 *    - Flex angles, IMU orientation/accel/gyro, touch status
 * 
 * üîπ STATISTICAL FEATURES: Analysis over time windows (70 features)
 *    - Mean, variance, std dev, min, max for each sensor channel
 *    - Helps capture stable poses and sensor reliability
 * 
 * üîπ TEMPORAL FEATURES: Motion and change analysis (33 features)
 *    - Velocities (first derivatives) of all measurements
 *    - Accelerations (second derivatives) for dynamic gestures
 *    - Range of motion and movement patterns
 * 
 * üîπ GESTURE-SPECIFIC FEATURES: Hand pose relationships (20 features)
 *    - Finger spread patterns, fist closure, thumb opposition
 *    - Pointing detection, hand flatness, gravity compensation
 *    - Pose stability and orientation-dependent features
 * 
 * üîπ FREQUENCY DOMAIN FEATURES: Spectral analysis (10 features)
 *    - Dominant frequencies in finger movements
 *    - Motion rhythm detection for dynamic gestures
 *    - Vibration and tremor analysis
 * 
 * üîπ NORMALIZATION: All features standardized (z-score normalized)
 *    - Ensures consistent scale across different feature types
 *    - Improves ML model training and recognition accuracy
 * 
 * @param sensor_data Current fused sensor data (input)
 * @param data_buffer Buffer containing historical sensor data for temporal analysis
 * @param feature_vector Output feature vector (will contain 162 normalized features)
 * @return ESP_OK on successful extraction, error code if extraction fails

 * üèÜ FEATURE INTERPRETATION GUIDE (For developers)
 * 
 * Understanding what each feature represents:
 * 
 * Features 0-4:    Current flex angles (degrees, 0-90)
 * Features 5-29:   Statistical flex features (normalized)
 * Features 30-44:  Temporal flex features (derivatives, normalized)
 * Features 45-53:  Current IMU data (orientation in degrees, accel in m/s¬≤, gyro in deg/s)
 * Features 54-98:  Statistical IMU features (normalized)
 * Features 99-116: Temporal IMU features (derivatives, normalized)
 * Features 117-121: Current touch status (0 or 1)
 * Features 122-131: Temporal touch features (frequencies, normalized)
 * Features 132-151: Gesture-specific features (hand pose analysis, normalized)
 * Features 152-161: Frequency domain features (Hz, normalized)
 * 
 * All features are normalized to roughly [-5, 5] range for ML compatibility.
